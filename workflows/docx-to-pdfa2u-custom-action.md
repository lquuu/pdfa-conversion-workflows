# Adobe Acrobat Guided Action: Batch Conversion to PDF/A-2u

## 1. Purpose
This workflow describes a reproducible process for batch-converting DOC and DOCX files to PDF/A-2u using Adobe Acrobat’s Guided Actions.

The workflow is designed for digital preservation and access contexts where Unicode text extractability and reliable PDF/A compliance are required.
