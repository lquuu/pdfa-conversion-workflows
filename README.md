# PDF/A Conversion Workflows

This repository documents the evaluation of document conversion workflows from DOC/DOCX to PDF/A-2u and PDF/A-2b for digital preservation and access contexts, with a focus on text extractability, metadata preservation, and batch processing behavior.


The work focuses on:

- Batch conversion behavior and stability
- Observed failures and limitations
- Metadata preservation across formats
- Workflow documentation suitable for library reuse


## Context

This responsitory was developed as part of research conducted at the University of Michigan Digital Preservation Lab, with the goal of producing reusable, documented workflows suitable for library and archival environments.

The work reflects my individual research, testing, and documentation; and is intended both for integration into institutional repositories and for public reference.


## Access Formats
While PDF/A is primarily a preservation format, this work explicitly evaluates conversion outputs as *access formats*, with particular attention to:

- Unicode text mapping and searchability (PDF/A-2u)
- Copy/paste fidelity for non-Latin scripts
- Metadata availability for discovery and resuse
- Tradeoffs between preservation complicance and practical access
