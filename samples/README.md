## Metadata Output Structure

This folder contains the artifacts produced by the metadata extraction and
comparison workflow.

- `originals_csv/` — Per-file metadata extracted from DOC/DOCX sources using ExifTool
- `converted_csv/` — Per-file metadata extracted from converted PDF/A-2u files
- `results/` — Field-level comparison tables generated by `compare_single_row_csvs.py`

Each file in `results/` contains one row per metadata field and classifies
changes as:

- Unchanged
- Modified
- Added in converted
- Removed from original
